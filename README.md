# aROMa - Telegram bot for managing game ROMs
aROMa is a Python code built using the pyTelegramBotAPI and SQLAlchemy as an ORM over a SQLite3 database for managing game ROMs on Telegram. Please note that this code is for educational purposes only and the ROMs are only accessible with an original copy of the game.

## Some features of the bot include:

Unlimited Telegram cloud storage for file archiving
Automatic backups to a Telegram channel
Gamification through reputation management (see Reputator Bot https://github.com/alanbimbati/TemplateTelegramBot)
Fun chat management inspired by Crash Bandicoot (crates, TNT, and Nitro will appear in the Telegram chat)
To ensure proper functionality, please configure the settings.py file by inserting the bot token and optionally, the test bot token by setting the TEST flag to 1.
